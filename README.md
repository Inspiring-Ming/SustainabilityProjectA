# Implementation Guide
## 

### Project Overview
This guide outlines the implementation tasks for the ESG Knowledge Graph Reasoning framework based on the research paper. You will be building a knowledge graph-based system that enables semantic reasoning for ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting.

### Completed Tasks(Previous Weeks)
- Initial analysis of Eurofidai dataset
- Industry-company matching
- Metrics sorting and classification
- Documenting findings for dataset and analysis process

### Knowledge Representation Setup
1. **Ontology Implementation**
   - Set up the core ontology with the seven key entities: ReportingFramework, Category, Metric, Model, Implementation, Dataset, and Datasource(Diagram shared previous week)
   - Implement the relationships between these entities as described in Section 4.1 (Shared at previosu week posts)
   - Add the semantic constructs: equivalence relationships, property axioms, and class hierarchies

2. **SASB Integration**
   - Integrate the SASB materiality map for industry-specific ESG categories (Website shared previous week)
   - Create the necessary entity mappings for your assigned industry(semiconductors etc..)

### Reasoning Mechanisms Implementation
1. **Ontological Reasoning**
   - Implement framework harmonization capabilities using equivalence relationships
   - Set up the class hierarchy reasoning for metrics categorization
   - Test with framework equivalence examples from Section 5.1(Shared at previosu week posts)

2. **Rule-based Reasoning**
   - Implement industry-specific requirement rules
   - Create the rule structure for determining required metrics based on industry and framework
   - Test with examples from Section 5.2(Shared at previosu week post)

### Advanced Reasoning & Data Integration
1. **Path-based Reasoning**
   - Implement data lineage and traceability functions
   - Create SPARQL queries for tracing relationships across the knowledge graph
   - Test with examples from Section 5.3(Shared at previosu week posts)

2. **Constraint-based Reasoning**
   - Implement data quality validation using SHACL constraints
   - Create constraints for required inputs and data completeness
   - Test with examples from Section 5.4(Shared at previosu week posts)

3. **Eurofidai Data Transformation**
   - Finalize the data processing pipeline for Eurofidai data
   - Implement the RDF transformation logic from Section 6.2(Shared at previosu week posts)

### System Architecture & API Development
1. **Layered Architecture Implementation**
   - Develop the four primary components: Data Layer, Knowledge Graph Layer, Reasoning Engine, and Application Interface
   - Implement the task orchestration logic for coordinating reasoning mechanisms

2. **API Development**
   - Create REST API endpoints for core functionalities
   - Implement the query service for knowledge retrieval
   - Document your API for future extension

### Workflow Implementation & Testing
1. **Complete Reporting Workflow**
   - Implement the six-step workflow described in Section 7.2(Shared at previosu week posts):
     - Framework and Industry Selection
     - Material Category Identification
     - Metric Selection
     - Model and Input Selection
     - Calculation Execution
     - Data Lineage Tracing

2. **Testing & Documentation**
   - Test the complete workflow with sample companies from different industries
   - Document your implementation decisions, extensions, and limitations
   - Prepare a demonstration of your working system

### Deliverables
1. Working implementation of the ESG-KGR framework
2. Documentation of your implementation decisions
3. Test cases demonstrating the system capabilities
4. Final presentation showing the complete workflow

### Extension Points (Optional)
If you complete the core tasks early, consider implementing one of these extensions:
1. Additional data source integration beyond Eurofidai
2. Temporal reasoning for ESG metrics
3. Enhanced visualization of the knowledge graph
4. Cross-framework harmonization features

### Resources
- The ESG-KGR research paper (already shared)
- Eurofidai dataset (already provided)
- SASB materiality map (link to be provided)
- Stardog documentation (for knowledge graph implementation)

### Technical Requirements
- Use of Stardog for knowledge graph implementation
- OWL 2 RL for ontological reasoning
- SWRL for rule-based reasoning
- SPARQL 1.1 for path-based reasoning
- SHACL for constraint-based reasoning
- RESTful API for system interaction
